# Project2_CAP4630_Shank
Description: This is for project 2 for CAP 4630 by Sadie Shank. I created a program that runs the Traveling Salesman Problem using Genetic Algorithm. It takes in three parameters (size of population, number of generations, and mutation rate) and tells how long the initial route was and how long the best route is once it has been passed through all of the functions. 

How to Run Project: Put the code into a compiler and run it. When prompted, input the three parameters asked for. Large parameters will take longer than shorter ones. The output will appear on the screen. 

Sources: This project was inspired by the following sources that immensely helped me in understanding this program. More information can be found in the comment on top of the .py file.
